# expressGram (WEB322 - Project) 
ExpressGram is a Node.js and Express.js based Instagram clone app project. 
Leveraging the power of NPM, the application allows users to share photos and interact with each other's posts.                                  


# Current BUGS
Dropdown not working with Bootstrap 5 (imported popper.js necessary but still not working) - maybe try a different way of showing data in the dropdown? like a modal or popup or tabs
east coast servers not working on campus so try to choose west coast
loginHistory array becomes too large after too many logins - maybe consider removing loginHistory entirely or saving less data into the document (i.e. not User-Agent)
